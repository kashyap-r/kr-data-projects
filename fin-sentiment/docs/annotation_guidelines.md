# Annotation Guidelines â€” Financial Sentiment (3-class)

## Labels
- **positive**: Clearly favorable financial impact or upside signal.
  - e.g., "beats estimates", "raises guidance", "surge", "upgrade to Buy".
- **negative**: Clearly adverse impact or downside signal.
  - e.g., "profit warning", "misses estimates", "SEC probe", "downgrade".
- **neutral**: Factual or mixed signal without clear directional impact.

## Rules of thumb
1. Prefer **direction** over scale: "beats", "misses", "cuts", "raises".
2. If both positive and negative signals appear, choose the **dominant** one.
3. If sentiment is speculative ("may", "could") and unclear, mark **neutral**.

## Examples
- Positive: "Company A raises full-year guidance"
- Negative: "Company B misses Q2 revenue and lowers outlook"
- Neutral: "Company C announces earnings date"
